This is made by using fossil-free materials, minimal additions and reuse of materials in production and later on in management. The plot for the preschool is in a beautiful nature area in Backa.

MARELD got the opportunity to design and produce construction drawings of the school yard. The design brings out the quality of the existing nature on the plot. There are different zones with more calm rooms for the small children as well as challenging areas for running and exploring.

The clay craftsman Johannes Riesterer writes on his facebook page: ""This building is now celebrating 20 years. It is a church, located just south of Stockholm, Sweden. It is built i wood, at least on the inside. On the outside, it is insulated with local made lightweight straw-clay blocks more than 7000 and plastered then with a plain clayplaster.
It was considered to be impossible and still it worked beautifully. I love to use it as an example, of how we can brake rules and still succeed. The foundation is not as high as usualy recommended, the surface is way too much exposed for weather and wind not treated with any kind of paint or sealant, and the roof is just  simply criminal. The mixture of the plaster makes all the difference in the world. The amount of clay is very high in comparision to the aggregate, the sand. We have a very rich clay to start with. We have a lot of fiber, oats-straw and hemp in the mixture. The final coat has also a a very high content of cow- and horse shit. With one part clay, we have maybe 2 parts cowshit and 1 part horse. I am convinced that this makes all the difference in the world.""",https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1525804/FULLTEXT01.pdf,walls,mix,plaster,
